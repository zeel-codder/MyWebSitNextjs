You are reading this blog that means you are my friend🤝.  So, i am create the blog  web site in next js. It take me more than 1 month to complete it. But know it ready to blog😇. 


For seo😎 and some other reason i select next js. Know I am want to rank my blogging web site on *Google* 🤘.  I have upload 2 blog on my web site. You can see all basic functionality which requires to blog are there like test highlight, code decoration😎 , img etc.



# Why I am tell this to you?

So , As we all are in collage. And we get only some amount of time to do other than codding and study 😡. And its required write at list 3 blogs per week for good result on web. And this is not feasible of an individual😒. Than I come across the idea  that let's blog together. As you  also in computer student. You can also write blogs😇. So if you wish you can write blog and increase your as well as other knowledge. 


# What you get if you write blogs?

Here I am not explaining the write blog benefits. Look I am not saying you have to write 2 3 blogs per week. It's total depends on you.  But as I am also student like you I know we can write at list one blog per week. It take only 2 4 h💪🏼. In benefits in further if over web site grow than I will pay for it. Also in main page you add as creator. And there are lots of benefits🤝. 

As we know together we can grow much faster than individual.  Also you do not need to think about web site maintains it all handle by me.

# What blogs can you write?

There no limits for topics. You can write any think new or you learn something. You can also write solution of error which you get while codding.
